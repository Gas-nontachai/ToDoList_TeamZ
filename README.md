This is a simple **Todolist** application built with **Next.js**, using **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components and **TailwindCSS** for styling. It supports sorting tasks by date, filtering by category, searching, and stores data locally using **IndexedDB**.

If you want the README translated back into Thai or into another language later, I can add localized README files (e.g., README.th.md).
